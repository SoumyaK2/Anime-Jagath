            <h3>Top 5 powerful anime character of all time :</h3>
            <div>
                <h4>1. Zeno ~Dragon Ball Super</h4>
                <p>Zeno is the ruler of every reality in Dragon Ball Super and he can both create and destroy all of
                    existence in a single instance. The child-like god possesses absolute power and can erase anyone and
                    thing on a whim. He doesn’t have any techniques or special moves, he is simply an all-powerful god
                    that commands space and time with youthful abandon.<br><br>

                    He’s destroyed numerous realities for his own entertainment and plays with galaxies as though they
                    were marbles. There is no way to stand against this god and only a single other anime character has
                    a chance of beating this god in a fight.

                <h4>2. Whis ~Dragon Ball Super</h4>
                <p>Despite his garb, which makes it look like he just took a wrong turn off the catwalk, Whis is an
                    incredibly powerful angel. He is the attendant and martial arts teacher for Beerus. We don’t
                    commonly think of angels as being more powerful than gods, but in this case they are. Whis is the
                    strongest being of Universe 7, and Beerus himself has stated that Whis is far stronger than him.
                    Whereas Super Saiyan God Goku could barely handle Beerus at half of his full strength, Whis knocked
                    out a rampaging Beerus with a single chop to the neck.<br><br>

                    He effortlessly fends off Goku and Vegeta simultaneously, casually dodging all of their best attacks
                    with his hands behind his back.

            <div>
                <h4>3. Beerus ~Dragon Ball Super</h4>
                <p>Beerus is not a cat you want to cuddle. He is the God of Destruction of Universe 7. He’s initially an
                    antagonist in the series, but later on becomes a supporting member of the cast. Like most cats, he
                    is perpetually lazy, but don’t let this distract you. He is incredibly powerful, being regarded as
                    one of the strongest among the 12 Gods of Destruction. His job is simple: maintain balance in the
                    universe.<br><br>

                    He does this by sleeping for several years to decades at a time and when he wakes up, he destroys a
                    couple planets to make room for new ones to grow.

                <h4>4. Goku ~Dragon Ball Super</h4>
                <p>The hero of hero among anime characters, Goku is legendary in terms of his power. From the beginning
                    of the Dragon Ball anime series, it has been made clear that most characters have the strength to
                    destroy entire planets. So, after the conclusion of Dragon Ball Super, Goku’s strength is almost
                    unfathomable. Time and time again he’s foiled the evil plans of alien overlords, vengeful androids
                    and destructive djinns. His Ka-me-ha-me-ha is arguably the most iconic signature move in anime and
                    has been the downfall of many foes.<br><br>

                    After the Tournament of Power, Goku has shown to have power levels rivaling that of the gods.

                <h4>5. Saitama ~One Punch Man</h4>
                <p>Saitama is the main protagonist of the One-Punch Man series. In a world filled to the brim with
                    superheroes and superpowers, Saitama rises far above the rest. He is so powerful in fact, that he
                    faces the daily existential crisis of being too strong to enjoy being a hero. When every battle ends
                    with one punch, fighting becomes a bit monotonous. How did he gain such a ferocious power? According
                    to him, it was a strict training regiment of 100 daily push-ups, sit-ups, squats and a 10-kilometer
                    run. However, most characters in the show don’t believe him, and the origins of his power are a
                    source of mystery.
